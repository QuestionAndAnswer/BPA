{"name":"The Ball Pivoting Algorithm PCL","tagline":"An implementation of The Ball Pivoting Algorithm using PCL","body":"#**The Ball Pivoting Algorithm**\r\n\r\nThe Ball Pivoting Algorithm (BPA) is an algorithm for surface reconstruction from 3D points. The algorithm uses a simple logic to decide how to build the mesh, based on pivoting a ball all along the points, adding a new triangle to the mesh each time the ball touches 3 different points (Fausto Bernardini et al. 1999).\r\n\r\nThis project presents an implementation of BPA which uses PCL to handle the input 3D cloud information. The output reconstructed mesh is given in [OFF format](http://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/off/off.html), which can be manipulated using several 3D data visualization software ([GeomView](http://www.geomview.org/) for example).\r\n\r\n\r\n**The last stable implementation can be found in the releases page (https://github.com/rodschulz/BPA/releases).**\r\n\r\n\r\nMore information about the algorithm can be found in the following links.\r\n* http://www.research.ibm.com/vistechnology/pdf/bpa_tvcg.pdf \r\n* http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=614442 \r\n","google":"UA-74480368-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
