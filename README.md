#**BPA - The Ball Pivoting Algorithm**

This an implementation of the Ball Pivoting Algorithm for surface reconstruction (Fausto Bernardini et al. 1999) which uses PCL to handle the cloud information.


**The last stable implementation can be found in the releases page (https://github.com/rodschulz/BPA/releases).**
